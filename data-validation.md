# Inspecting & Validating Data

The quality of your backtesting results is directly dependent on the quality of your historical data. Before running a strategy, it is essential to inspect your downloaded data to ensure it is complete and consistent. Gaps, duplicates, or other errors in your data can lead to misleading backtest results.

Stochastix provides a dedicated command-line tool, `stochastix:data:info`, to help you with this process.

::: tip UI Alternative
Data files can also be inspected and validated from the [**Data Validation modal in the UI**](./screenshots#data-validation).

## The `data:info` Command

This command reads a `.stchx` binary data file and displays its metadata and a sample of its content. Its most powerful feature is the ability to perform a full consistency validation on the data.

### Command Signature

```bash
make sf c="stochastix:data:info <file-path> [options]"
```

### Argument

* **`file-path`**: The full path to the `.stchx` file you want to inspect.

### Example

```bash
make sf c="stochastix:data:info data/market/binance/ETH_USDT/1d.stchx"
```

## Inspecting File Contents

When run without any options, the command provides a quick overview of the file:

1.  **Header Metadata**: It displays the key information from the file's header, such as the `Symbol`, `Timeframe`, and the total `Number of Records` contained within the file.
2.  **Data Sample**: It shows the first 5 and last 5 records from the file. This is useful for a quick sanity check to ensure the timestamps and price ranges look correct.

## Validating Data Consistency

The most important feature of the `data:info` command is the `--validate` flag. When this option is added, the tool will iterate through every single record in the file to check for common data quality issues.

```bash
make sf c="stochastix:data:info data/market/binance/ETH_USDT/1d.stchx --validate"
```

The validation checks for three types of problems:

1.  **Gaps**: The time difference between every consecutive record is checked. If it doesn't match the file's timeframe (e.g., 86,400 seconds for a `1d` file), it is flagged as a gap.
2.  **Duplicates**: The tool checks for any records that have the exact same timestamp as the one before it.
3.  **Out of Order**: The tool ensures that timestamps are always increasing. Any timestamp that is less than the previous one is flagged.

### Interpreting the Validation Output

* **If the data is clean**, you will see a "passed" status:

    ```bash
    üîç Data Consistency Validation
    -----------------------------

    ¬†[OK] Data appears consistent.
    ```

* **If problems are found**, you will see a "failed" status with a detailed list of every issue, including the index of the problematic record:

    ```bash
    üîç Data Consistency Validation
    -----------------------------

    ¬†[ERROR] Found 2 issue(s).

    Gaps:
    -----
    ¬†! [WARNING] - At index 452: Diff: 172800s, Expected: 86400s

    Duplicates:
    -----------
    ¬†! [WARNING] - At index 788: Timestamp 1698883200
    ```

::: tip Best Practice
Always run your downloaded data through the `--validate` check before using it for backtesting. Clean data is the bedrock of trustworthy results. If you find errors, it's best to re-download the data from the exchange or another source.
